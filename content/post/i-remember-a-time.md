I remember a time
back before the world lured us into its snare
where we could just be
and not manipulate

A faint, fuzzy memory
like a flickering candle in a storm
but one full of hope

I remember when
we could look at each other
want nothing
expect nothing
demand nothing
insist nothing
prefer nothing
discern nothing

A simple existence
that looked no further than what what seen

Child-like wonder
The fall from grace
The loss of innocence
Now self, now other

I commit to returning
through the violent storm
wearing nothing but flesh
to that, to us
even if it costs us Us

Lost in judgment
Lost in expectation
Lost in scheming
Lost in mistakes
Is not life, but hell

In this moment
I renew this commitment
And strive
As if my head were aflame

You shall not know me to judge
You shall not know me to condemn
You shall not know me to scheme
You shall not know me to impinge morality
With this moment, just now
