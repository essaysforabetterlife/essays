I remember a time<br>
back before the world lured us into its snare<br>
where we could just be<br>
and not manipulate<br>

A faint, fuzzy memory<br>
like a flickering candle in a storm<br>
but one full of hope<br>

I remember when<br>
we could look at each other<br>
want nothing<br>
expect nothing<br>
demand nothing<br>
insist nothing<br>
prefer nothing<br>
discern nothing<br>

A simple existence<br>
that looked no further than what what seen<br>

Child-like wonder<br>
The fall from grace<br>
The loss of innocence<br>
Now self, now other<br>

I commit to returning<br>
through the violent storm<br>
wearing nothing but flesh<br>
to that, to us<br>
even if it costs us Us<br>

Lost in judgment<br>
Lost in expectation<br>
Lost in scheming<br>
Lost in mistakes<br>
Is not life, but hell<br>

In this moment<br>
I renew this commitment<br>
And strive<br>
As if my head were aflame<br>

You shall not know me to judge<br>
You shall not know me to condemn<br>
You shall not know me to scheme<br>
You shall not know me to lie<br>
You shall not know me to impose morality<br>
With this moment, just now<br>
Even when, especially when<br>
You don't have that commitment
