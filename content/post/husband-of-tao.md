# Husband of Tao

A husband in whom Tao acts without impediment
Never raises his voice in anger
and does not know himself to be pious, or virtuous

A husband in whom Tao acts through and through
does not use games and tricks to get his wife to behave
and does not mind when she tries to

He does not have anger for his partner
he does not make a virtue of kindness
he goes his own way, independent of ignorant advice
and does not mind when she browses Instagram

Doting affection and threats
do not deter him. 
Love and anger
are of no concern
A furrowed brow, a smile
are one and the same

While he gives unconditionally
and does not demand anything of her
He does not mind when, in that, he is alone
