# Husband of Tao

A husband in whom Tao acts without impediment<br>
Never raises his voice in anger<br>
and does not know himself to be pious, or virtuous

A husband in whom Tao acts through and through<br>
does not use games and tricks to get his wife to behave<br>
and does not mind when she tries to

He does not have anger for his partner<br>
he does not make a virtue of kindness<br>
he goes his own way, independent of ignorant advice<br>
and does not mind when she browses Instagram

Doting affection and threats<br>
do not deter him. <br>
Love and anger<br>
are of no concern<br>
A furrowed brow, a smile<br>
are one and the same

While he gives unconditionally<br>
and does not demand anything of her<br>
He does not mind when, in that, he is alone
