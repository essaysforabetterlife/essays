When your demons overflow<br>
And the darkness creeps in from all sides.<br>
When void is also red<br>
when the sky has an avalanche.<br>
When ordinary pain would feel better<br>
and the urge to reject is a black hole.<br>
When a tornado of lightning is reported from every nerve<br>
when your fear has its own fear<br>
and you are nothing more than a mouse<br>
in someone else's cage

Down in the depths<br>
deeper and deeper still<br>
deeper than the skin, flesh, bones<br>
even the marrow.<br>
More essential than water, air, breath, heartbeat<br>
a blind man begins to see.<br>
Refusing to plug your ears from darkness<br>
it glows<br>
a silent ember in a dry forest<br>
a redwood tree seed in fertile ground.<br>
Just<br>
coming home<br>
